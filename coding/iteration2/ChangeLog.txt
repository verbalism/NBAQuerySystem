* No hardcoded option format - In cmdoption-0.0.4 and before you could give
  one long parameter (inplicitly starting with a "--") and a short option
  (starting with one "-"). Since version 0.1.0 you are no longer limited in
  format and count, just use the names argument of CmdOption annotation.
  Remember, to include the hyphen(s) in the name, as those are no longer
  implicit.
* The Parser class is now CmdlineParser - The old one CmdOptionParser no longer
  exists.
* Support for commands - When CmdOption detects a command, all subsequent
  arguments are parsed into that command exclusivly.
* External UsageFormatter - You have the full control over the appearance of
  the usage/help.
